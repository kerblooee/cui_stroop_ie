Cui Stroop - The Stroop task used in Cui et al (2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    The experiment is similar to a classic Stroop task. Participants will see a
brief (32 ms) color word (RED, GREEN, or BLUE), always presented in black font. 
In the 32 ms prior to the word, the background color of the display will change. 
The background color is either congruent with the word, or incongruent. 
Participants are asked to respond ONLY to the identity of the word and ignore the 
background color.

Analysing your data:

    You will get 1 data file per block. Each block contains 24 trials, which is 2x
a counterbalanced list of conditions (3 colors x 2 congruent trials x 2 incongruent
trials). Both response times and accuracies are collected.

Notes: 
    
    This experiment is adapted from the PsychoPy Builder demo "Stroop_Extended".
